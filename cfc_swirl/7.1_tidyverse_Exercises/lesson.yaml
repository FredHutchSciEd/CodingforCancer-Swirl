  AND all columns that contain 'RB1', assign this to RB1_clinical"

  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "RB1_clinical <- select(clinical, tissue_or_organ_of_origin:total.number.Indels, contains('RB1'))" )
  Hint: "put the parameters in the order its in the question (tissue_or_organ_of_origin THROUGH total.number.Indels THEN contains RB1)"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "take a look at RB1_clinical using View()"
  CorrectAnswer: View(RB1_clinical)

  Hint: "look at the values in each column"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "now that we have the columns we want lets filter the rows to get the data we want to analyze"
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "go back to your RB1_clinical tab, how many rows are there?"
  AnswerChoices: 124; 433; 960; 3
  CorrectAnswer: 433
  AnswerTests: 433
  Hint: "look at the bottom of the pane or scroll to the bottom"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "filter RB1_clinical to show just the rows that have 'Primary Tumor' in sample_type,
  assign to filter1"
  CorrectAnswer: filter1 <- filter(RB1_clinical, sample_type == "Primary Tumor")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'filter1 <- filter(RB1_clinical, sample_type == "Primary Tumor")')
  Hint: 'what do you want the sample_type columne to equal?'
  
- Class: cmd_question

  CorrectAnswer: 64
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 64)
  Hint: "take the number of rows shown and add the number omitted (skipped), R 
  will only show a certain number of rows when printing but it will tell you how 
  many it skipped or omitted from print"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "now lets filter for rows that have an RB1 mutation (mutation.in.RB1 is 'yes')
  assign this to filter3"
  CorrectAnswer: filter3 <- filter(RB1_clinical, mutation.in.RB1 == 'yes')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "filter3 <- filter(RB1_clinical, mutation.in.RB1 == 'yes')")

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "how many rows are in filter3?"
  AnswerChoices: 64, 70, 414, 18
  CorrectAnswer: 70
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 70)

- Class: txt
  Output: "remember RB1_clinical is already narrowed down to only show related columns"

- Class: txt
  Output: "and what we are interested in looking at is the data of patients who have 
  deleted or lost RB1 or has a mutation in RB1"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "lets combine the filters from above to filter for RB1_clinical patients
  who have either 'Del' OR 'Loss' in focal.deletion.in.RB1 OR 'yes' in mutation.in.RB1,
  assign this to filter_all"
  CorrectAnswer: filter_all <-  filter(RB1_clinical, focal.deletion.in.RB1 == "Del" |
  focal.deletion.in.RB1 == "Loss" | mutation.in.RB1 == "yes")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'filter_all <-  filter(RB1_clinical, focal.deletion.in.RB1 == "Del" |
  focal.deletion.in.RB1 == "Loss" | mutation.in.RB1 == "yes")' )
  Hint: "combine the filters from filter2 and filter3 using | for or"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "open up filter_all"
  CorrectAnswer: View(filter_all)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "View(filter_all)")
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "how many rows are in filter_all?"
  AnswerChoices: 64, 70, 414, 114
  CorrectAnswer: 114
