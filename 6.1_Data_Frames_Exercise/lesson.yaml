  Output: "welcome to the Data Frames class exercises!"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "lets practice downloading a data frame and importing it"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "before we download the data for the file, lets make the directory (aka a folder)"

- Class: txt
  Output: "the function dir.create('folder_name') creates a folder in your current working directory (the folder you are currently working in) called data"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "make a new directory called 'data' using the function"
  CorrectAnswer: dir.create('data')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="dir.create('data')")
  Hint: "fill in 'folder_name' with 'data'"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "you should see a new folder in your Files tab named data, do you see the folder?"
  AnswerChoices: yes; no
  CorrectAnswer: 'yes'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="yes")
  Hint: "check the Files tab in the the Plots, Packages, and Help pane"
  
- Class: txt 
  Output: "now we are going to download the data from a website called Github"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'run this command, download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FredHutchSciEd/CodingforCancer/main/clinical.csv", "data/clinical.csv")'
  CorrectAnswer: download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FredHutchSciEd/CodingforCancer/main/clinical.csv","data/clinical.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= 'download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FredHutchSciEd/CodingforCancer/main/clinical.csv", "data/clinical.csv")')
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "now that you downloaded the data, lets import it in to R and assign it to an object"

- Class: txt
  Output: "to do this we will use the read.csv() function"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "this function reads a file that is in a table format (like a spreadsheet) and creates a data frame"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "you need to input the file you want it to read, in our case it's the clinical.csv file we saved in the data directory"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "in one line, use the read.csv() function on data/clinical.csv and assign that to a new variable called clinical"
  CorrectAnswer: clinical <- read.csv("data/clinical.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "clinical <- read.csv('data/clinical.csv')")
  Hint: "put 'data/clinical.csv' into the function"
 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "view the data you just downloaded using the View() function"
  CorrectAnswer: View(clinical)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="View(clinical)")
  Hint: "make sure that the V is capitalized"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "did a new window open with the data frame?"
  AnswerChoices: yes; no
  CorrectAnswer: yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='yes')
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "you can assess the size of the data frame using the function dim(data_frame_name)"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "this will tell you the number of rows and columns in your data frame"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "get the dimesnions of clinical"
  CorrectAnswer: dim(clinical)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="dim(clinical)")
  Hint: "put our data frame name, clinical, in as the argument"
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "how many rows are in clinical?"
  AnswerChoices: 433; 79; 82; 1
  CorrectAnswer: 433
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '433')
  Hint: "what is the first number that was returned in your previous command?"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "you can preview the first few rows using the function head(data_frame_name)"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "get the first few rows of clinical"
  CorrectAnswer: head(clinical)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="head(clinical)")
  Hint: "put our data frame name, clinical, in as the argument"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "you can see the last three rows of your data frame using the function tail(data_frame_name, n=3)"
  CorrectAnswer: tail(clinical, n=3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="tail(clinical, n=3)")
  Hint: "put our data frame name, clinical, in as the argument"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "you can view column names using the function colnames(data_frame_name)"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "view the column names in clinical"
  CorrectAnswer: colnames(clinical)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="colnames(clinical)")
  Hint: "what's the name of our data frame?"

- Class: txt
  Output: "this is a data frame with information on different bladder cancer tissue samples"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "from the column names you can see the type of data that was collected for each sample"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "this includes stuff like the sample type, age at diagnosis, and information on specific gene expression"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "to view the row names, use the function rownames(data_frame_name)"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "view the row names in clinical"
  CorrectAnswer: rownames(clinical)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="rownames(clinical)")
  Hint: "the argument should be our data frame"
   
- Class: txt
  Output: "from this you should see sequential numnbers"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "these are the sample numbers for each sample, which is why you just see numbers"

- Class: txt
  Output: "if you want to see an overview of a data frame you can use the function str(data_frame_name)"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "try getting an overview of clinical"
  CorrectAnswer: str(clinical)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="str(clinical)")
  Hint: "put in the name of our data frame into the function"

- Class: txt
  Output: "this function gets you the structure of your data frame"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "take a look at the output, you should see the header name, type of data stored, examples of values etc"

- Class: txt
  Output: "or if you want an overview of the data frame you can use the function summary(data_frame_name)"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "ask R for a summary of clinical"
  CorrectAnswer: summary(clinical)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="summary(clinical)")
  Hint: "add clinical into the function"

- Class: txt
  Output: "this gets you summary statistics of each column"

- Class: txt
  Output: "take a look at the output, you'll see that it gives you the legnth and class of each column"

- Class: txt
  Output: "for numerical columns, it also calcualted the Min, Median, Mean, Max, and quartiles"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what is the median year of diagnosis?"
  AnswerChoices: 1999; 2013; 2010, 2011
  CorrectAnswer: 2011
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="2011")
  Hint: "look at the summary statistics from your previous command"

- Class: txt
  Output: "good job getting started with data frames!"
