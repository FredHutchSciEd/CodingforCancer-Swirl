  AnswerChoices: numeric; logical; character; integer
  CorrectAnswer: character
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "character")
  Hint: "what is surrounded by ' ' "
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "there is a function (we will learn more about these tomorrow) that we can use to check"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "class() is a function that tells you the data type of the inputted value"

- Class: txt
  Output: "you can use the function by typing class() and inserting the value into the ()"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "lets find the data type of organs using the fuction class()"
  CorrectAnswer: class(organs)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "class(organs)")
  Hint: "type class(organs)"

- Class: txt
  Output: "R tends to handle interpreting data types in the background of operations"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "the following code is designed to cause some unexpected results in R"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "make a vector num_char with the following values, (1, 2, 3, 'a')"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the data type of first value in num_char?"
  CorrectAnswer: class(num_char[1])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = " class(num_char[1])")
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "in this case, R changed the numeric values in the num_char to characters"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "remember that all values in a vector have the same data type, so R does work in the background to not break this rule"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "now make a vector called num_logical with values (1, 2, 3, TRUE)"
  CorrectAnswer: num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "num_logical <- c(1,2,3, TRUE)")

- Class: txt
  Output: "what do you expect the data type in num_logical to be?"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the data type of num_logical?"
  CorrectAnswer: class(num_logical)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "class(num_logical)")

- Class: txt
  Output: "lets see what R did to keep the data type the same"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the 4th value in num_logical (the one we entered as TRUE)"
  CorrectAnswer: num_logical[4]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "num_logical[4]", correctVal = 1)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what happened to the value TRUE in num_logical?"
  AnswerChoices: R changed TRUE to 1; no change; magic?
  CorrectAnswer: "R changed TRUE to 1"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "R changed TRUE to 1")
  Hint: "what is the difference between what you entered and what is stored in the vector?"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "add the value FALSE to the end of num_logical"
  CorrectAnswer: num_logical <- c(num_logical, FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "num_logical <- c(num_logical, FALSE)")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "now check on the 5th value of the vector (the one we just added)"
  CorrectAnswer: num_logical[5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "num_logical[5]", correctVal = 0)
  Hint: "have R tell you what the 5th value of the vector is"

- Class: txt
  Output: "to keep the data type numerics for all values, R changed TRUE to 1, and FALSE to 0"

- Class: txt
  Output: 'lets take a look at what happens with the other values are characters, not numerics'
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "make a third vector called char_logical with values ('a', 'b', 'c', TRUE)"
  CorrectAnswer: char_logical <- c ('a', 'b', 'c', TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "char_logical <- c ('a', 'b', 'c', TRUE)")
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "what do you expect the data type of this vector to be?"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "find out the data type of char_logical"
  CorrectAnswer: class(char_logical)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "class(char_logical)")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the 4th value in the char_logical?"
  CorrectAnswer: char_logical[5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "char_logical[5]", correctVal = "TRUE")
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what happened to the 5th value in char_logical?"
  AnswerChoices: R changed TRUE (logical) to 'TRUE' (character); no change; R swapped values out)
  CorrectAnswer: "R changed TRUE (logical) to 'TRUE' (character)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "R changed TRUE (logical) to 'TRUE' (character)")
  Hint: "what is different about the TRUE you entered and the TRUE R outputted?"

- Class: txt
  Output: "R changes the data types of what it can to make the data types all the same across values in a vector"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "lets make one last vector called tricky with values (1,2,3, '4')"
  CorrectAnswer: tricky <- c(1,2,3,'4')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "tricky <- c(1,2,3,'4')")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the data type of tricky?"
  CorrectAnswer: "class(tricky)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "class(tricky)", correctVal = "character")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the 3rd value in tricky (we entered it as a numeric 3)?"
  CorrectAnswer: tricky[3]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "tricky[3]")
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what happened to the value?"
  AnswerChoices: R changed a numeric to a character; no change; R is playing tricks
  CorrectAnswer: "R changed a numeric to a character"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "R changed a numeric to a character")

- Class: txt
  Output: "R is doing a lot in the background, most of the time you don't need to think about it"

- Class: txt
  Output: "but it is good to know what is happening so that if you run into an issue, you can troubleshoot"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "good job learning more about vectors!"
