  Output: "welcome to the intro to vectors challenge problems"


- Class: txt
  Output: "now that we have the basics, let's get some practice with more complicated vectors"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "we're going to import a more complicated data set, copy the next three lines of code and run it (don't worry about understanding this for now)"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "copy this and run it: TG = ToothGrowth"
  CorrectAnswer: TG = ToothGrowth
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="TG = ToothGrowth")
  
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: 'copy and run: low_dose=TG[which(TG$supp=="OJ"&TG$dose==1),"len"]'
  CorrectAnswer: low_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 1), "len"]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= 'low_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 1), "len"]')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'copy and run: high_dose=TG[which(TG$supp=="OJ"&TG$dose==2),"len"]'
  CorrectAnswer: high_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 2), "len"]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr=' high_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 2), "len"]')
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "remember you don't need to understand the syntax of the code you just ran, just know it imported a bigger dataset"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "look in your Environment pane to see this dataset"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "the data you just imported is from the paper Effect of vitamin C on odontoblast growth in guinea pig teet"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "Scientists treated guinea pigs with low or high dose vitamin C (via orange juice) for a set period of time and then measured the odontoblast (cells responsible for repairing/maintaing the dentin in your tooth) length (in picometeres)"

- Class: txt
  Output: "Source: Crampton, E. W. (1947). The growth of the odontoblast of the incisor teeth as a criterion of vitamin C intake of the guinea pig. The Journal of Nutrition, 33(5), 491â€“504. doi: 10.1093/jn/33.5.491."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "how many elements are in low_dose?"
  CorrectAnswer: length(low_dose)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="length(low_dose)", correctVal="10")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "how about high_dose?"
  CorrectAnswer: length(high_dose)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="length(high_dose)", correctVal="10")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the mean of low_dose?"
  CorrectAnswer: mean(low_dose)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="mean(low_dose)", correctVal="22.7")
  Hint: "the function for mean is mean()"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what about the mean of high_dose?"
  CorrectAnswer: mean(high_dose)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="mean(high_dose)", correctVal="26.06")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the 5th element in low_dose?"
  CorrectAnswer: low_dose[5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="low_dose[5]", correctVal="20")
  Hint: "the accessor operator is []"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "subset the first THROUGH fifth element of low_dose"
  CorrectAnswer: low_dose[1:5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='low_dose[1:5]')
  Hint: ", is the operator for AND, : is the operator for THROUGH"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "create a new variable called low_dose_subset and assing it the subset you created above"
  CorrectAnswer: low_dose_subset <- low_dose[1:5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "low_dose_subset <- low_dose[1:5]")
  Hint: "the assignment operator is <-"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the mean of low_dose_subset?"
  CorrectAnswer: mean(low_dose_subset)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="mean(low_dose_subset)")

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "is the mean of low_dose_subset higher or lower than the mean of low_dose?"
  CorrectAnswer: higher
  AnswerChoices: higher;lower;same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="higher")
  Hint: "scroll up to find the mean of low_dose you calcuated before"

- Class: txt
  Output: "good job with importing a more complicated vector and analyzing it!"
