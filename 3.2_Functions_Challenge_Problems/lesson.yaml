- Class: txt
  Output: "welcome to the challenge problems for the Functions lesson!"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "lets start the extra practice for the many functions in R"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "we are going to practice looking up new functions"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "we have a new function called trunc, use the help feature to look up this function"
  CorrectAnswer: ?trunc
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "?trunc")
  Hint: "the help feature is ?"
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what is the argument for the function trunc"
  AnswerChoices: single numeric; multiple numerics; strings; logicals
  CorrectAnswer: single numeric
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "single numeric")

- Class: txt
  Output: "the R help description was confusing, so lets try googling this function"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "search 'trunc function R docs' in Google"
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "do you see the search result from Rdocumentation.org?"
  AnswerChoices: yes; no; huh?
  CorrectAnswer: yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "yes")
  Hint: "make sure 'R docs' is in your search"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "this is the official R website with documentation with every R function"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "you can use this or other websites with user information like Stack Exchange whenever you need a refresher on fucntions"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "now that we know a little bit about trunc(), let's try using it"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "you have 32 cows in a pasture, assign total the number of cows in the entire pasture"
  CorrectAnswer: total <- 32
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="total <- 32")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "you want to divide the cows into 3 groups for going out to graze, find the number of cows in each group and assign it to per_group"
  CorrectAnswer: per_group <- total / 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="per_group <- total/3")
  Hint: "use the stored value per_group"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "since you can't have part of a cow, truncate this number to figure out how many cows will be in eaech group"
  CorrectAnswer: trunc(per_group)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "trunc(per_group)")
  Hint: "use the stored value per_group"
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "how many cows are in each group?"
  AnswerChoices: 3;21;32;10
  CorrectAnswer: 10
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "10")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "how many cows are left in your pasture if you put the number stored in per_group into the 3 groups, calculate this and assign it to cows_left"
  CorrectAnswer: cows_left <- total - trunc(per_group)*3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "cows_left <- total - trunc(per_group)*3")
  Hint: "use the stored value, cows_left should equal total cows - the truncated value of cows per group * number of groups"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "print cows_left to see how many cows you have left in the pasture"
  CorrectAnswer: cows_left
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "cows_left", correctVal= 2)
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "there are many resources available when learning how to code"

- Class: txt
  Output: "in this program, we also have resources and coding help sheets available for you in Google Classroom"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "in a seperate window, open up Google Classroom and find the Coding Helpsheet for this week"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what is the very last function in the Functions section of the Coding Helpsheet?"
  AnswerChoices: sqrt; round; substr; max
  CorrectAnswer: substr
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="substr")
  Hint: "go to the Week 1 Coding Helpsheet in Google Classroom"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "lets try using this function"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "look up this new function in the help window"
  CorrectAnswer: ?substr
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "?substr")
  Hint: "? is the help operator"

- Class: text_question
  Output: "what does this function do, copy the description from the help window"
  CorrectAnswer: Extract or replace substrings in a character vector.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "Extract or replace substrings in a character vector.")
  Hint: "copy and paste the description"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "copy this 'cows like to eat grass when they go to pasture' and assign it to the value song"
  CorrectAnswer: song <- "cows like to eat grass when they go to pasture"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "song <- 'cows like to eat grass when they go to pasture' ")
  Hint: "it should be in one line, like this song <- 'cows like to eat grass when they go to pasture'" 

- Class: txt
  Output: "the argument of this function can be found in the help window"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "lets take the first 22 characters of that phrase using the substr function"
  CorrectAnswer: substr(song, 1, 22)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "substr(song, 1, 22)", correctVal = "cows like to eat grass")
  Hint: "you want to extract the 1st through the 22nd characters"

- Class: txt
  Output: 'remember if any functions are confusing you can always look them up in R and on the internet!'
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "great job with the Functions Challenge Problems!"
