- Class: text_question
  Output: "what did we learn today that can store multiple values?"
  CorrectAnswer: vectors
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="vectors")
  Hint: "the main topic of today's lesson"
  
- Class: text_question
  Output: "what is the name of the position of an element in a vector?"
  CorrectAnswer: "index"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="index")
  Hint: "this is the number that's assigned to each element, you can use it to access elements in vectors"
  
- Class: text_question
  Output: "what is the operator (symbol) used to access elements within vectors? "
  CorrectAnswer: "[]"
  AnswerTests: (correctVal="[]")
  Hint: "this symbol is called the accessor"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "let's try making a vector to practice"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'make a vector called organs with these values ("lung", "prostate", "breast")'
  CorrectAnswer: organs <- c("lung", "prostate", "breast")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='organs <- c("lung", "prostate", "breast")')
  Hint: "the function for making vectors is c()"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'add "ovaries" to the end of the vector organs'
  CorrectAnswer: organs <- c(organs, "ovaries")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= 'organs <- c(organs, "ovaries")')
  Hint: "is the new value going to the beginning or end of the vector?"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "now that we have the basics, let's get some practice with more complicated vectors"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "we're going to import a more complicated data set, copy the next three lines of code and run it (don't worry about understanding this for now)"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "copy this and run it: TG = ToothGrowth"
  CorrectAnswer: TG = ToothGrowth
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="TG = ToothGrowth")
  
- Class: cmd_question 
  Output: 'copy and run: low_dose=TG[which(TG$supp=="OJ"&TG$dose==1),"len"]'
  CorrectAnswer: low_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 1), "len"]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= 'low_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 1), "len"]')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'copy and run: high_dose=TG[which(TG$supp=="OJ"&TG$dose==2),"len"]'
  CorrectAnswer: high_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 2), "len"]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr=' high_dose = TG[which(TG$supp == "OJ" & TG$dose == 2), "len"]')
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "remember you don't need to understand the syntax of the code you just ran, just know it imported a bigger dataset"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "look in your Environment pane to see this dataset"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "the data you just imported is from the paper Effect of vitamin C on odontoblast growth in guinea pig teet"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "Scientists treated guinea pigs with low or high dose vitamin C (via orange juice) for a set period of time and then measured the odontoblast (cells responsible for repairing/maintaing the dentin in your tooth) length (in picometeres)"

- Class: txt
  Output: "Source: Crampton, E. W. (1947). The growth of the odontoblast of the incisor teeth as a criterion of vitamin C intake of the guinea pig. The Journal of Nutrition, 33(5), 491â€“504. doi: 10.1093/jn/33.5.491."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the 5th element in low_dose?"
  CorrectAnswer: low_dose[5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="low_dose[5]", correctVal="20")
  Hint: "the accessor operator is []"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "subset the first THROUGH fifth element of low_dose"
  CorrectAnswer: low_dose[1:5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='low_dose[1:5]')
  Hint: ", is the operator for AND, : is the operator for THROUGH"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "create a new variable called low_dose_subset and assign it the subset you created above"
  CorrectAnswer: low_dose_subset <- low_dose[1:5]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "low_dose_subset <- low_dose[1:5]")
  Hint: "the assignment operator is <-"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the 7th element in high_dose?"
  CorrectAnswer: high_dose[7]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'high_dose[7]')
  Hint: "use the accessor we learned about today"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "subset the 3rd THROUGH 10th element of high_dose"
  CorrectAsnwer: high_dose[3:10]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "high_dose[3:10]")
  Hint: ", is the operator for AND, : is the operator for THROUGH"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "create a varible called high_dose_subset and assign the subset you created above"
  CorrectAnswer: high_dose_subset <- high_dose[3:10]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "high_dose_subset <- high_dose[3:10]")
  Hint: "the assignment operator is <-"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the 9th element of high_dose?"
  CorrectAnswer: high_dose[9]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "high_dose[9]")
  Hint: "use the accessor []"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "subset high_dose to EXCLUDE the 9th element"
  CorrectAnswer: high_dose[-9]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr =  "high_dose[-9]")
  Hint: "negative numbers are used to exclude those positions"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "now make a subset of high_dose that EXCLUDES the 6th THROUGH 9th elements"
  CorrectAnswer: high_dose[-6:-9]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "high_dose[-6:-9]")
  Hint: "combine THROUGH and EXCLUDE"

- Class: txt
  Output: "nice work creating and using vectors!"
