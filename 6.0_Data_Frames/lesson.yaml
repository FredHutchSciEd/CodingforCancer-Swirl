- Class: txt
  Output: "welcome to the Data Frames lesson!"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what is a data frame?"
  AnswerChoices: a vector; a combination of variables; a list; a character
  CorrectAnswer: a combination of variables
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "a combination of variables")
  Hint: "data frames are useful because they do what with the variables we are interested in?"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what does each column in a data frame contain?"
  AnswerChoices: a data set; a data point; a variable; a number
  CorrectAnswer: a variable
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "a variable")
  Hint: "a data frame is a combination of what?"
  
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "okay now lets make a data frame!"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "we are going to make a data frame of books in a class library"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'first make a variable called book_title that is a vector of these book titles ("Beloved", "One Hundred Years of Solitude", "Handmaids Tale") '
  CorrectAnswer: book_title <- c("Beloved", "One Hundred Years of Solitude", "Handmaids Tale")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'book_title <- c("Beloved", "One Hundred Years of Solitude", "Handmaids Tale")')
  Hint: "the function for making vectors is c()"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'now make a variable called book_authors that is a vector of these authors ("Toni Morrison", "Gabriel Garcia Marquez",  "Margaret Atwood")'
  CorrectAnswer: book_authors <- c("Toni Morrison", "Gabriel Garcia Marquez",  "Margaret Atwood")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= 'book_authors <- c("Toni Morrison", "Gabriel Garcia Marquez",  "Margaret Atwood")')
  Hint: "make another vector using c()"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "finally, make a third variable called book_pages that is a vector of these page numbers (324, 422, 311)"
  CorrectAnswer: book_pages <- c( 324, 422, 311)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="book_pages <- c( 324, 422, 311)")
  Hint: "make a third vector, use c()"

- Class: txt
  Output: "you just made three separate variables that contain book titles, the authors, and the page count"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "these currently live separately in your computer"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "lets bring them together by making them in to a data frame"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "you can make a data frame using this function, data.frame(column1 = variable1, column2 =  variable2, ...)"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "where column1, column2, ... are the names of each column and variable1, variable2, ... are the variables stored in each column"

- Class: txt
  Output: "to make the dataframe you assign a new variable the combination of the dataframe variables (ex: dataframe <- data.frame(column1 = variable1, column2 = variable2)"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "similar to vectors!"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "make a data frame called books_df, name your columns title, author, and pages"
  CorrectAnswer: books_df <- data.frame(title = books_title, author = book_authors, pages= book_pages)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'books_df <- data.frame(title = book_title, author = book_authors, pages= book_pages)')
  Hint: "fill in the variable and column names, books_df <- data.frames(column1 = variable1, column2 = variable2, column3 = variable3)"

- Class: txt
  Output: "you just made a data frame!"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "lets try taking a look at it, use this function View(insert_data_frame_name)"
  CorrectAnswer: View(books_df)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "View(books_df)")
  Hint: "make sure V is capitalized"

- Class: txt

  Output: "a new window should have opened with your data frame"
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "do you see your data frame?"
  AnswerChoices: yes; no
  CorrectAnswer: yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="yes")
  Hint: "look at the tabs in your Source Pane"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "now that you made a data frame, lets try accessing values in it"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what operator can we use to access columns (variables) in data frames?"
  AnswerChoices: ?; $; %
  CorrectAnswer: $
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = '$')
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "access the variable pages in our books_df data frame"
  CorrectAnswer: books_df$pages
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="books_df$pages")
  Hint: "what is the operator for accessing variables?"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "now try accessing the variable author in our books_df data frame"
  CorrectAnswer: books_df$author
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "books_df$author")
  Hint: "change the variable out to authors in the command earlier"

- Class: txt
  Output: "$ gets you the entire variable (the vector)"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "but you can also access specific values like a vector"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what is the operator used for acessing specific values in a vector?"
  AnswerChoices: ();[];{}
  CorrectAnswer: '[]'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="[]")
  Hint: "what surrounds the index?"

- Class: txt
  Output: "to access the specific value use [] after the command to access the variable"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "i.e. dataframe$variable[index]"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "access the page value of One Hundred Years of Solitude, the second value in pages"
  CorrectAnswer: books_df$pages[2]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="books_df$pages[2]")
  Hint: "fill in the names of the following dataframe$variable[index]"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "now try accessing the author of One Hundred Years of Solitude, the second value in author"
  CorrectAnswer: books_df$author[2]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="books_df$author[2]")
  Hint: "change the variable name to author"

- Class: txt
  Output: "good work making and accessing data frames!"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "the secret word of the day is 'the powerhouse' "
