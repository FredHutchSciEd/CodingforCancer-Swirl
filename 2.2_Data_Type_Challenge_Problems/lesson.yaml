  Output: "welcome to the challenge problems for the data types lesson"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "as a reminder, these are set up for additional practice with R for folks who finish the class exercises early"

- Class: txt
  Output: "you work at a bodega that sells candy, a popular item here is the chocolate bar"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "assign an object, item, with the value 'chocolate bar'"
  CorrectAnswer: "item <- 'chocolate bar' "
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "item <- 'chocolate bar' ")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "each chocolate bar costs $1.25, assign the object price with the price of the chocolate bar as a numeric"
  CorrectAnswer: "price <- 1.25"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "price <- 1.25")
  Hint: "remove the $ sign"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "WA state is a state with sales tax of 6.5%, calculate the total price of the 1 chocolate bar with sales tax, assign this to a new object called with_tax"
  CorrectAnswer: "with_tax <- price *1.065"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "with_tax <- price*1.065")
  Hint: "use your stored values instead of retyping the price, to get the total price with sales tax multiply the price by 1.065"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "how much would it cost to buy 6 chocolate bars BEFORE tax?"
  CorrectAnswer: "price*6"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="price*6", correctVal = "7.5")
  Hint: "multiply your stored value for price before tax by the number of chocolate bars"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "how much would it cost to buy 6 chocolate bars AFTER tax?"
  CorrectAnswer: "with_tax * 6"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "with_tax *6", correctVal = "7.96")
  Hint: "multiply your stored value for price with tax by the number of chocolate bars"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "the price of the chocolate bar goes down to $1.15 per bar before tax, re-assign price to what you just calculated"
  CorrectAnswer: "price <- 1.15"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "price <- 1.15")
  Hint: "re-assignments can be done by overwriting a previous assignment"
  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what is the new price with tax per chocolate bar, re-assign with_tax with this new value?"
  CorrectAnswer: "with_tax <- price*1.065"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="with_tax <- price*1.065")
  Hint: "to get the total price with sales tax multiply the price by 1.065"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "you receive a large order of chocolate bars, the quantity requested is seventy chocolate bars"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "make a new object called quantity and assign it 'seventy' "
  CorrectAnswer: "quantity <- 'seventy' "
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="quantity <- 'seventy")

- Class: txt
  Output: "you are asked to calculate the price of this large order"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "since you were storing these values as you went you should be able to just ask R to do price*quantity or with_tax*quantity"
  
- Class: mult_question 
  Output: "but if try either of those calculations you will get an error, why?"
  AnswerChoices: R cannot do math; R is confused; you did not store the right values; the data type of quantity is wrong
  CorrectAnswer: "the data type of quantity is wrong"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "the data type of quantity is wrong")
  Hint: "what types of data can you do math with?"
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what data type is price?"
  AnswerChoices: string; boolean; numeric; integer
  CorrectAnswer: "numeric"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "numeric")
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "what data type is quantity?"
  CorrectAnswer: "string"
  AnswerChoices: string; boolean; numeric; integer
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "string")
  Hint: "the other name for this data type is characters"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "re-assign quantity in the correct data type to do the calculation"
  CorrectAnswer: "quantity <- 70"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "quantity <- 70")
  Hint: "change the string into a number"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "calculate the price after tax for this large order"
  CorrectAnswer: "with_tax*quantity"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "with_tax*quantity", correctVal="85.33")
  Hint: "the total price for this order is the price multiplied by the quantity"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "great work on these challenge problems!"
